            With this vision in mind, emphasis is given on toxin free yield,
            providing guidance & support to farmers. Lakhpati sheti and
            Siddhagiri Naturals are being the role models to be adopted. One of
            the Krishi Vidgyan Kendra (KVK) has also been established in the
            math province. Math is also actively promoting the importance of
            organic farming and desi cows. Desi cows have also been given equal
            importance, as if to have a good doctor for a family.

            To provide better education facilities, various educational camps
            and science exhibitions had also been organized at Math every year.
            Vidyachetana is one such initiative helping ZP schools and their
            students excel. Siddhagiri Gurukulam is a perfect assimilation of
            our traditional ways of learning (Guru-Shishya parampara) and modern
            education system. Gurukulam is a place where learning is Happiness
            centric (Ananda Kendrit) and not money centric. To connect to our
            Cultural roots, Siddhagiri Museum has brought our indigenous ways of
            living to reality. It perfectly depicts how villagers were
            interdependent, but were independent collectively (a self-sufficient
            village).

            Siddhagiri believes that, "Everyone has the moral right to avail
            modern healthcare facilities". With this belief, Sidhagiri
            Aarogyadham, consisting of Siddhagiri Hospital & Research Center
            (SHRC) and Siddhagiri Ayurdham, is serving everyone with minimal or
            no cost. Yog-gram, Suwarna Bindu and other traditional practices
            have been encouraged for building a healthy lifestyle and preventing
            diseases.

              As P.P. Shri. Muppin Kadsiddheshwar Swamiji Maharaj had
              envisioned, Siddhagiri Math has become Bhu-Kailasa(heaven on
              earth) for everyone.
